Project: Civilization 112, by Ishaan Ghosh
A two-player turn-based game in which players compete in a 2D square-grid world to create cities, expand and conquer the other player; inspired by the Civilization games

The  files needed are the cmu_112_graphics.py and game.py files in the same folder, as well as the settlerIcon, warriorIcon, archerIcon and cityIcon image files. Running the game.py file in an editor will run the project.
No external libraries/modules were used.

Shortcut Commands:
n - creates a warrior in a random location on the map, owned by the current player
